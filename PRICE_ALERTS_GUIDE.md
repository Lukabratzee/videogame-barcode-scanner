# Price Alerts Guide - Discord Notifications

## üéØ Overview

Your Video Game Catalogue now includes a **completely free** notification system for price alerts! When you scrape prices using your existing scrapers, the system automatically detects significant price changes and sends notifications to Discord.

## üöÄ How It Works

### **Automatic Detection**
- **No API costs**: Uses your existing scraping infrastructure
- **Smart thresholds**: Only alerts on significant price changes (configurable)
- **Discord notifications**: Free webhook-based alerts
- **Per-game settings**: Custom thresholds and sources per game
- **Automatic scraping**: Scheduled background price checking

### **Notification Flow**
1. You scrape prices using existing tools (eBay, Amazon, CeX, PriceCharting)
2. System compares new prices to previous prices in your database
3. If change meets threshold ‚Üí sends Discord notification
4. Supports per-game custom settings and automatic scheduling

## ü§ñ Setting Up Discord Notifications

1. **Go to your Discord Server**
   - Right-click on the channel you want notifications in
   - Select "Edit Channel"

2. **Create Webhook**
   - Go to "Integrations" tab
   - Click "Create Webhook"
   - Name it "Game Price Alerts"
   - Copy the **Webhook URL** (it will look like: `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/123456789012345678/AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrSt`)

3. **Configure in App**
   - Go to **üîî Alerts** page in your app

- **CeX**: Good for pre-owned games

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Discord Issues
- **Webhook URL**: Make sure you copy the entire URL including the token at the end
- **Permissions**: The webhook needs permission to post in the channel
- **Server**: You must be a server admin or have "Manage Webhooks" permission

### No Alerts Being Sent
- Check that you've scraped prices recently (alerts only trigger on new price data)
- Verify thresholds aren't too restrictive
- Test using the test button to ensure Discord webhook is working
- Check if per-game settings have disabled alerts for specific games

### Automatic Scraping Not Working
- Ensure "Enable Automatic Price Scraping" is checked
- Check that you have games with alerts enabled
- Verify the auto_price_scraper.py script can access your scrapers
