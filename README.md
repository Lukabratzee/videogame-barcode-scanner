## üöÄ Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (for the recommended Docker setup)
- **Python 3.11** (for local development without Docker)
- **Git** (to clone the repository)

### Option 1: Running with Docker (Recommended)

This is the easiest and most reliable way to get the application running. It uses pre-built Docker images and handles all dependencies automatically.

#### Quick Start (One-Command Setup)

For your convenience, standalone scripts are provided to set up and run the application with a single command.

**For Mac/Linux users:**
```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukabratzee/video-game-catalogue/main/run-video-game-catalogue.sh
chmod +x run-video-game-catalogue.sh
./run-video-game-catalogue.sh
```

**For Windows users:**
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukabratzee/video-game-catalogue/main/run-video-game-catalogue.ps1" -OutFile "run-video-game-catalogue.ps1"
.\run-video-game-catalogue.ps1
```

These scripts will:
- Create the necessary `data/` and `config/` directories.
- Generate a `docker-compose-standalone.yml` file.
- Pull the latest multi-architecture Docker images.
- Start the frontend and backend services.
- Display real-time application logs.

#### Manual Docker Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone 192.168.1.111:3000/lukabratzee/video-game-catalogue
    cd video-game-catalogue
    ```

2.  **Using GitHub Container Registry (ghcr)**
    This method pulls pre-built images.
    ```sh
    docker-compose -f docker-compose-ghcr.yml up -d
    ```

3.  **Access the Application**
    - **Frontend**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`
    - **Backend API**: The backend service is accessible at `http://localhost:5001`
    - **Health Check**: You can check the status of the backend at `http://localhost:5001/health`

### Option 2: Running Locally (Without Docker)

This method is suitable for developers who want to modify the source code or run the application in their native Python environment.

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone 192.168.1.111:3000/lukabratzee/video-game-catalogue
    cd video-game-catalogue
    ```

2.  **Set Up Environment**
    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and specify the database path. For example:
        ```
        DATABASE_PATH=data/games.db
        ```
    - It's recommended to use a virtual environment:
        ```sh
        python3 -m venv .venv
        source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    - **Backend**:
        ```sh
        cd backend
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    - **Frontend**:
        ```sh
        cd ../frontend
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

4.  **Database Setup**
    - The application will automatically create the SQLite database file at the path specified in your `.env` file when it first tries to access it.
    - You can manually run the database setup script if needed:
        ```sh
        cd backend
        python database_setup.py
        ```

5.  **Run the Application**
    - You need to run both the frontend and backend simultaneously in separate terminal windows.
    - **Backend** (in one terminal):
        ```sh
        cd backend
        python app.py
        ```
    - **Frontend** (in another terminal):
        ```sh
        cd frontend
        streamlit run frontend.py
        ```
    - Access the frontend at `http://localhost:8501`.

    - There is also a dedicated "Export All Games" section in the sidebar for exporting the entire database.

### Price Scraping

- The application can automatically scrape prices from eBay, Amazon, or CeX when adding games.
- You can set your preferred price source globally in the "Price Scraping Settings" in the sidebar. This selection will be used for all subsequent price lookups.
- The backend stores this preference, so it persists even if you restart the application.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables (`.env` file)

- `DATABASE_PATH`: Specifies the location of the SQLite database file. Example: `data/games.db`. This path is relative to the project root.

### Application Configuration (`config/config.json`)

This file is automatically generated and managed by the application. It stores user preferences such as:
- `price_source`: The default source for price scraping (`"eBay"`, `"Amazon"`, or `"CeX"`).

You generally do not need to edit this file manually, as the application provides UI controls to manage these settings.

## üé® Artwork Management

The application can automatically fetch high-resolution artwork from SteamGridDB, but you can also manually add artwork for games.

### Automatic Artwork Fetching

1. **Configure SteamGridDB API Key**: Get a free API key from [SteamGridDB](https://www.steamgriddb.com/profile/preferences/api)
2. **Add to Config**: Place your API key in `config/config.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "price_source": "PriceCharting",
     "steamgriddb_api_key": "your_actual_api_key_here"
   }
   ```
3. **Use the Editor**: In the sidebar, use "Update Game Artwork" to fetch artwork for specific games

### Manual Artwork Installation

If automatic fetching fails or you prefer custom artwork, you can manually add images:

1. **Download artwork** from [SteamGridDB](https://www.steamgriddb.com/) or any source
2. **Rename files** using the following convention:
   - **Grid Cover**: `<game_id>_grid.png` (e.g., `1234_grid.png`)
   - **Hero Image**: `<game_id>_hero.png` (e.g., `1234_hero.png`) 
   - **Logo**: `<game_id>_logo.png` (e.g., `1234_logo.png`)
   - **Icon**: `<game_id>_icon.png` (e.g., `1234_icon.png`)
3. **Place files** in the `data/artwork/` directory
4. **Restart the application** - it will automatically detect and use the new artwork

#### Artwork File Types

- **Grid Cover**: Square or portrait game cover (600x900px recommended)
- **Hero Image**: Wide banner image (1920x620px recommended)
- **Logo**: Game logo with transparent background (PNG recommended)
- **Icon**: Small square icon (256x256px recommended)

#### Finding Game IDs

- **In Gallery**: The Game ID is displayed on each game tile
- **In Editor**: View any game to see its ID in the "Game Information" section
- **In Database**: Check the `id` column in the games table

**Note**: Manual artwork takes precedence over automatically fetched artwork. If you place a manual file, it will be used instead of the SteamGridDB version.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting & FAQ

### **ChromeDriver/Selenium Issues (Price Scraping)**

Price scraping relies on Selenium and ChromeDriver. Sometimes, version incompatibilities can arise.

- **Error**: `ChromeOptions error` or issues with `undetected-chromedriver`.
- **Solution**:
    1.  Ensure you have the latest version of Google Chrome installed.
    2.  In your local environment (not Docker), try reinstalling the relevant Python packages:
        ```sh
        pip uninstall -y selenium undetected-chromedriver webdriver-manager
        pip install selenium==4.23.1 undetected-chromedriver==3.5.5 webdriver-manager==4.0.2
        ```
    3.  The Docker images are configured with compatible versions, so this issue is less likely when using Docker.

### **Application is not accessible after running the script**

- **Check Docker**: Ensure Docker Desktop is running.
- **Check Ports**: Verify that ports `5001` and `8501` are not being used by other applications.
- **Check Logs**: View the container logs for errors:
    ```sh
    docker-compose -f docker-compose-standalone.yml logs
    ```

### **iOS Shortcut is not working**

- **IP Address**: The most common issue is an incorrect IP address in the shortcut. Make sure you have updated it to the IP address of the machine running the `backend` service.
- **Network**: Ensure your iPhone is on the same network as the machine running the application.
- **Backend Health**: Check that the backend is running and accessible at `http://YOUR_BACKEND_IP:5001/health`.

### **Database errors on startup**

- **Permissions**: Ensure the application has write permissions in the `data/` directory.
- **`.env` file**: Double-check that the `DATABASE_PATH` in your `.env` file is correct and that the directory for the database file exists.
