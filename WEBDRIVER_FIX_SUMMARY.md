# Chrome WebDriver Fix Summary

## Problem
The WebDriver was failing with error: 
```
WebDriverException: Service /root/.local/share/undetected_chromedriver/undetected_chromedriver unexpectedly exited. Status code was: -5
```

## Root Cause
The ChromeDriver initialization was failing in the Docker environment due to:
1. Incorrect driver path configuration
2. Missing essential Chrome arguments for containerized environments
3. No fallback mechanism for driver initialization
4. Improper headless mode detection

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated `frontend/modules/scrapers.py`
- Added robust `get_chrome_driver()` function with fallback mechanisms
- Enhanced `get_chrome_options()` with Docker-specific arguments
- Updated all scraper functions to use the new safe driver initialization
- Added proper error handling and driver cleanup

### 2. Updated `modules/scrapers.py` (root level)
- Applied the same fixes as frontend scrapers
- Added environment-based driver path detection
- Enhanced Chrome options for Docker compatibility
- Implemented safe driver initialization with multiple fallback options

### 3. Updated `backend/app.py`
- Added imports for scraper functions from the modules directory
- Removed duplicate scraper function definitions
- Cleaned up commented-out code

### 4. Enhanced Chrome Options
Added essential arguments for Docker/headless operation:
- `--no-sandbox`
- `--disable-dev-shm-usage`
- `--disable-gpu`
- `--remote-debugging-port=0`
- `--disable-background-timer-throttling`
- `--disable-backgrounding-occluded-windows`
- `--disable-renderer-backgrounding`
- `--disable-ipc-flooding-protection`
- `--headless=new` (when in Docker environment)

### 5. Driver Initialization Strategy
Created a three-tier fallback system:
1. Try with specified ChromeDriver path
2. Fall back to automatic driver detection
3. Last resort: explicit Chromium/ChromeDriver paths

## Environment Variables
The scrapers now properly use these environment variables:
- `CHROMEDRIVER_BIN`: Path to ChromeDriver binary
- `CHROME_BIN`: Path to Chrome/Chromium binary
- `DISPLAY`: Used to detect Docker environment

## Docker Configuration
The Docker setup includes:
- Chromium browser installation
- ChromeDriver installation
- Proper symlinks for compatibility
- Environment variables for paths

## Testing
Created `test_chrome_driver.py` for verifying the driver initialization works correctly.

## Next Steps
1. Test the application in Docker environment
2. Monitor logs for any remaining driver issues
3. Consider adding retries for network-related scraping failures
